          <h4>Intent</h4>
          <blockquote>
            Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one
            object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated
            automatically.

            You are creating your own game. In the game, multiple system have to
            interact to provide the player with a full experience. In this
            example, our game has 3 such systems:
            <strong>Physics System</strong> (responsible for simulating physics
            like falling objects and forces ...),
            <strong>Audio System</strong> (plays the necessary game sounds) and
            <strong>Achievements system</strong> (displays a popup for the user
            whenever he accomplishes a new achievement)

          <h5>Questions</h5>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Start by copying the start code and reading it. What do you think
              about the code structure ?
            </li>
            <li>
              How would you go about decoupling the different systems by using
              the observer pattern ?
            </li>
            <li>
              Let's say you want to add a UI system to display the player's
              health in a health bar. How hard would it be to integrate it ?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong class="primary-color">[Event system variation]</strong>
              How about observing the interesting action that is happening
              instead of the subject it is happening on ?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong class="primary-color">[Linked List variation]</strong> To
              improve program speed and avoid memory churn, you decide to use a
              linked list instead of a List.

        <h3>🔂 State pattern</h3>
        <div>
          <h4>Intent</h4>
          <blockquote>
            State is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its
            behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the
            object changed its class.

          <h4>Example</h4>
          <p>
            You are creating a platformer game. In your game, the character can
            do multiple actions. The character can for example
            <strong>Jump</strong> (Only if he's Standing, we have to avoid
            Double jumps), <strong>Duck (crouch)</strong> (Only he's Standing)
            and <strong>Dive</strong> (If the player presses down while Jumping,
            the character does a <strong>Dive</strong>).

            Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that defines the
            skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses
            override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its
            structure.
