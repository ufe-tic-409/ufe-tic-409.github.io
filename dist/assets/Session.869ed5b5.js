What we can do in this case is extract those steps in the parent and have each one change only the steps it needs to change."},{body:"How would you simplify this code by using the Template method pattern ?",answer:"What we did here is that we made Entity an abstract class instead of an interface to enable some of it methods to have bodies. Then we created the 'algorithm' method (takeTurn) that contains the different steps (collectFood, attack, build), some of those steps had a default implementation (like attack) and some not. We finally, made the 'algorithm' (takeTurn) final so that no one of its children can override and thus no-one can change the order of the steps. The only thing that children can do now is override some of the steps if they need to.",code_link:"https://github.com/ufe-tic-409/design-patterns-examples/tree/template-method-1/src/main/java/io/gawish/templatemethod"}]}};function D(){return D=Object.assign||function(e){for(var t=1;t<arguments.length;t++){var a=arguments[t];for(var n in a)Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(a,n)&&(e[n]=a[n])}return e},D.apply(this,arguments)}function M(e,t){if(e==null)return{};var a={},n=Object.keys(e),o,s;for(s=0;s<n.length;s++)o=n[s],!(t.indexOf(o)>=0)&&(a[o]=e[o]);return a}function De(e,t){if(!!e){if(typeof e=="string")return U(e,t);var a=Object.prototype.toString.call(e).slice(8,-1);if(a==="Object"&&e.constructor&&(a=e.constructor.name),a==="Map"||a==="Set")return Array.from(e);if(a==="Arguments"||/^(?:Ui|I)nt(?:8|16|32)(?:Clamped)?Array$/.test(a))return U(e,t)}}function U(e,t){(t==null||t>e.length)&&(t=e.length);for(var a=0,n=new Array(t);a<t;a++)n[a]=e[a];return n}function He(e,t){var a;if(typeof Symbol=="undefined"||e[Symbol.iterator]==null){if(Array.isArray(e)||(a=De(e))||t&&e&&typeof e.length=="number"){a&&(e=a);var n=0;return function(){return n>=e.length?{done:!0}:{done:!1,value:e[n++]}}}throw new TypeError(`Invalid attempt to iterate non-iterable instance.
