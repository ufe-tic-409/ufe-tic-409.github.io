                answer: "The code structure isn't good because we are having to check manually in the Player class for the different environment setting & manually create the corresponding classes based on the setting. This means that having to add a new environment will not only mean having to add the corresponding classes but also having to remember to change the \'if' condition in the player class. Which is not good. Optimally, the Player class shouldn't have to concern about the different types of Transports or Weapons or even about the environmentSetting, he should simply be able to call `travel` or `visit` or `attack` and the system should have to handle calling the right method depending on the user's chosen environmentSetting."
