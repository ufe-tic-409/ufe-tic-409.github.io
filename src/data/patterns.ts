The problem lies in the fact that conceptually, the Physics system shouldn't have to know about the Achievement System or the Audio System for example. In the ideal scenario, the Physics System should say that 'The player fell' and then each other System should independently react to this event. This is what the observer pattern helps us to do. Decouple the different systems in our software, by having a System send events and other systems subscribe to getting notified when this event happens and then react to it."
